# asynchttpserver
A simple and lightweight asynchronous HTTP server library based on Netty for Java

Don't know how to start with building a simple HTTP application server? Tired of using old-fashioned JSP or Servlet for implementation of very lightweight HTTP services of your server? Maybe you should try this library. It's simple and fast.
This library allows Java applications to easily receive HTTP requests, process them, and send back responses asynchronously. It's built on top of [Netty](https://netty.io/) and supports Java 8 and above.
## Features
1. Direct integration into your Java project.
1. High performance with the power of [Netty](https://netty.io/) and Java NIO.
2. Very lightweight with almost zero overhead.
3. Suitable for building simple application services, user content services, and public API services.
## Progress
This project is currently under development.
